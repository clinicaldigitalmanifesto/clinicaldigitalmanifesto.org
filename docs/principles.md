# Principles For Working Together To Achieve Our Aims

## 3.1

### We are open to anyone who is committed to our manifesto and making it a reality within the NHS

## 3.2

### We do not seek to replicate or replace what others such as NHS England, HL7 FHIR or OpenEHR are doing

## 3.3

### We are independent from any other body or organisation

## 3.4

### We do not make a profit, but re-invest any income or donations to advancing our manifesto and improving digital experiences for NHS staff and patients

## 3.5

### We share our work and progress openly and regularly, and seek feedback about our approach to achieve our vision for a modern, open and user-centric approach to digital in the NHS
