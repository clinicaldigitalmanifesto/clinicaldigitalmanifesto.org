## Stuff to do

'Digital Clinical Misery' was a more powerful CTA - can we add some of that vibe back in somehow?

Evidence pages for each of the assertions in the Problem Statement

'Get Involved' page instead of Survey

Library of Useful Stuff - links, videos, docs etc

* Atul Gawande - why doctors hate their computers
* Jerry Harvey - the Abilene Paradox
* Larry Weed's grand rounds

Add the new pages from the GDoc
