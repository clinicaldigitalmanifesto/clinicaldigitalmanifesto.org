Let's start by creating the necessary files for the MkDocs project. We will need a `mkdocs.yml` configuration file, a `Dockerfile` for building a Docker image, a `docker-compose.yml` for local development, and a `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies. We will also need a `docs` directory for our documentation files.
